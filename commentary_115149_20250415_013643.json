CSK have not only snapped their losing streak, but also broken the three-match winning run of LSG. Rishabh Pant finally made some runs for the hosts but it wasn't enough with the pitch probably getting better in the second half in the presence of dew. Things did get tight towards the end for CSK but Dhoni came to their rescue. That's all we have from this one. Until next time, it's goodbye from Sagar Chawla on behalf of Siva, Nikhil Jadhav and Raju Peethala!",

There can be lots of reasons. It's good to have a win on our side. Gives confidence to the whole team and helps us improve in areas we want to improve. We all knew that when it doesn't come your way in cricket, God makes it very tough, and it was a tough game. If you see the powerplay, whether it was the combination or the conditions, we were struggling with the ball. And then we weren't able to get the start we wanted as a batting unit. Also the fall of wickets. We keep losing wickets at the wrong time to some extent. One of the reasons could be that the Chennai wicket is slightly on the slower side. When we have played away from home, the batting unit has done slightly better. B1$ so that it'll give the batters confidence to play their shots. B2$ We were putting too much pressure on Ash. He was bowling two overs in the first six. We made changes and this looks like a better attack. As a bowling unit we've done well. As a batting unit, we can do better. Roles and responsibilities - that's what we talk about. If you get off to a good start, and you're someone who can play through the innings, then why not. I think he batted really well today. He has been with us for quite a few years (Shaik Rasheed). This year he has been batting really well in the nets against both pacers and spinners. It's just the start. He has the capability to dominate with authentic shots. Even today I was like - \"why are they giving me the award?\" Noor bowled really well.",

It's not about the mindset and it is about playing according to situation which is why instead of attacking, I felt taking the game deep was a better option. My plan was very simple which is not try and hit the ball very hard because bowlers were executing very well. Taking positives from this game to next game is very important.",

His quickfire 26 off just 11 balls, along with Dube finally finding his touch towards the end was enough to get them over the line, giving their fans something to celebrate in what has been slim pickings so far this season. But there's still time to turn it around, and this is just the boost they desperately needed. In previous run-chases, they had struggled to get a quickfire start and left too much to do in the final overs, but there was a refreshing change today. For once, they managed to get ahead of the rate early in the powerplay with some cracking shots from IPL debutant Shaik Rasheed and Rachin Ravindra. Things did get tricky as there was a middle-overs slowdown initiated by the spin trio of Digvesh, Bishnoi and Markram. Questions might be asked of why Bishnoi wasn't bowled out. Pant could've gone to him when Dhoni walked out in the 16th over when CSK still needed 56 off the last five. Maybe there was the fear of Dube who had spent time in the middle. But in any case, he went with his pacers and they all disappeared with Dhoni taking no time to get going.",
